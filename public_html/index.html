   Summary
   <br>
   The art that Bishop, and I chose to recreate was really simple. Just a penrose triangle, <br>
   we were orignally hoping to create a program that would create penrose polygons, but that <br>
   seemed to be a little out of reach in the time we had. So in the end we decided on <br>
   something a little simpler.
   <br>
   <br>
   Our interpretation is really simple, really all we did was flip it upside down and <br>
   due to our inability to color the inside, we opted to change the color of the lines. <br>
   we chose more saturated colors because the pastel colors were too faint.
   <br>
   <br>
   The code is really simple, it just draws line between coordinates that we input.
